# Shiny.AppDeviceBridge — Working Notes

Guidance for maintaining this repo. Code lives in `src/`, tests in `tests/`, samples in `samples/`, the
published Claude Code skill in `skills/`, and the public documentation site in a **separate** repo at
`~/Desktop/dev/documentation` (rendered to https://shinylib.net/appdevicebridge).

AppDeviceBridge hosts a web app — typically Blazor WebAssembly — inside a native .NET MAUI app, serves it
from a loopback HTTP server built on Shiny.Net.HttpServer, updates it over the air from a signed release
server, and gives the page device access through **bridges**: HTTP endpoints under a guarded prefix, one
package each (`Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Wifi`, `.BluetoothLE`, `.Notifications`, `.TrayIcon`, …). The host
is `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge`; `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Core` holds the protocol contracts,
`Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Maui` the MAUI integration, `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Blazor` the page-side client,
and `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.AspNetCore` the release server.

Every bridge also has a `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.{Bridge}.Client` package: its contracts and a `[BridgeClient]`
interface that `Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Client.SourceGenerators` implements. The native bridge serializes the same
contracts — a bridge change starts in its `.Client` project, never in a private DTO. The TypeScript clients in
`clients/typescript/src` are generated from those assemblies by `tools/Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.TypeScript`
(`dotnet run --project tools/Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.TypeScript`); a new `.Client` project is added to that tool's
csproj, and `TypeScriptClientTests` fails until the output is regenerated and committed.

## Removing or replacing code — no leftover cruft

This is an open-source library; keep the tree clean. When a member, type, or package is removed or
replaced, **delete it outright** — do not leave `[Obsolete]` shims, deprecated no-op methods, forwarding
stubs, dead flags, or "kept for back-compat" wrappers behind. A clean breaking change with a release note
is preferred over accumulating compatibility cruft. Update every call site, test, sample, and doc in the
same change so nothing references the removed thing. (Semantic versioning + release notes communicate the
break; the code stays lean.)

## After every new feature or fix

A change is not "done" until the four artifacts below are in sync. Do all of them in the same
change unless there's a reason not to.

1. **Code + tests** (`src/`, `tests/`)
   - **Platforms are explicit.** The heads are Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS (AppKit, via
     dotnet/maui-labs), Windows and Linux (GTK4, via maui-labs). A bridge either works on a platform or
     answers `501` there — state which platforms a change covers in its release note, and never let an
     unsupported platform fail in a way other than `501`.
   - **Security lives in the host's guard.** Bridges are device access: they stay behind the session cookie
     on the device and the `RemoteAccess` allowlist off it, and are kept out of the authorization policies
     that govern an app's own endpoints. A change that loosens either is a security change — call it out.
   - **Always run the tests and ensure coverage after every feature/bugfix prompt** — a change is not done
     until the suite is green *and* the new/changed behavior has a test proving it. Run the **full** suite
     (`dotnet test tests/Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Tests/Shiny.AppDeviceBridge.Tests.csproj`), not a filtered
     subset. Some tests reach this machine's LAN address to exercise remote access and skip when there is
     none — say so if they skipped rather than reporting them as passing.
   - The trim/AOT analyzers are on for everything that ships. A change that introduces reflection or an
     unannotated dynamic dependency is a regression, not a warning to suppress.
   - **When behavior is visible in the app, see it in the app.** The `run-appdevicebridge` project skill
     launches the macOS AppKit sample and drives it; use it for anything a unit test cannot show — a bridge
     answering a real page, a tray icon in the menu bar, the page loading under a moved mount point.
     Apple builds need `-p:ValidateXcodeVersion=false` on this machine.

2. **Documentation site** (`~/Desktop/dev/documentation/src/content/docs/appdevicebridge/`)
   - Update the relevant feature page (a bridge's page, hosting, security, updates, …).
   - Add a **release note** — see the release-note rules below.
   - Pages are `.mdx`; release notes use the `<RN>` component
     (`import RN from '/src/components/ReleaseNote.astro'`), with `type="feature|enhancement|fix|breaking"`.
   - A brand new page also needs a sidebar entry in `astro.config.mjs` in that repo.
   - Check the site still builds (`npx astro build` in the documentation repo) — MDX that does not compile
     breaks every page, not just the one edited.

3. **Skill** (`skills/shiny-appdevicebridge/SKILL.md`)
   - This is the source of the published `shiny-appdevicebridge` Claude Code skill — the agent-facing
     "how to generate correct code" doc.
   - Keep `SKILL.md` aligned with the code. Update the `triggers:` keyword list near the top when a
     new public type / bridge package / API is introduced.
   - If the default or recommended pattern changes, the skill's default guidance must change too.

4. **readme.md** (repo root)
   - This file is packed into the NuGet package (`PackageReadmeFile` in `Directory.Build.props`).
     Update the package table, the bridges table and any inline guidance when behavior changes.

## Release notes

Release notes live in the documentation repo at
`~/Desktop/dev/documentation/src/content/docs/appdevicebridge/release-notes.mdx`.

**Which version does a note go against?** Use the `version` field in `version.json` (this repo uses
Nerdbank.GitVersioning) — **the raw version portion only** (strip any prerelease/build-metadata
suffix, e.g. `1.0.0-beta.{height}` → `1.0.0`).

**Heading style — match the existing file.** Feature/minor releases are headed by `major.minor`
(`## 1.1 - June 13, 2026`); patch releases use the full `major.minor.patch` (`## 1.0.2 - May 30,
2026`). Pick the heading that matches the kind of release you're cutting.

**If the version isn't released yet (beta / prerelease, or work-in-progress for the next version):**
- If a `## <version> TBD` heading already exists, **add the note under that existing section**. If
  you're modifying a feature that hasn't shipped yet (already an entry under a `TBD` section), edit
  that existing entry in place rather than adding a duplicate.
- If no section exists for that version yet, **create a new `## <version> TBD` heading** at the top
  and add the note there.

**If the version is a final release**, the section is dated (`## 1.1 - June 13, 2026`); add the note
under the matching dated section (or promote the `TBD` section to a dated one when cutting the
release).

Each note is a single `<RN>` line. Use `type="breaking"` for breaking changes (it's its own note
type here, not a flag). Newest version section stays at the top of the file.

## Blog posts (only when explicitly requested)

Do **not** write blog posts automatically as part of a fix/feature. Write them **only when the user asks**. When asked to blog a feature, produce **two** posts — first the docs-site version, then adapt it for the personal blog.

### 1. Docs site — `~/Desktop/dev/documentation`

- File: `src/content/docs/blog/YYYY/MM/<slug>.mdx` (current year/month folders; create the month folder if needed).
- Frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: '...'
  description: '...'
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  authors:
    - allanritchie
  tags:
    - Release        # or Feature, AI, etc.
  ---
  ```
- Body is MDX. Reuse components where relevant, e.g. `import NugetBadge from '/src/components/NugetBadge.astro';` then `<NugetBadge name="Shiny.AppDeviceBridge" />`.
- Voice: product/release-note tone — what shipped, breaking changes, code samples, how to use it. **No hero image** on this site.

### 2. Personal blog — `~/Desktop/dev/blog` (adapt the docs post)

- File: `src/content/blog/YYYY/MM/<slug>.mdx` (note: `content/blog`, not `content/docs/blog`).
- Frontmatter (different schema — see `src/content.config.ts`):
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: '...'
  description: '...'
  pubDate: 'Mon DD YYYY'                          # e.g. 'Jun 15 2026'
  heroImage: '../../../../assets/<slug>-hero.svg'
  tags: ['Shiny', '.NET']
  ---
  ```
- Voice: rework the docs post into a personal, first-person narrative ("Here's something that shouldn't be hard but is…", "So I built…") — story/motivation up front, not a dry changelog.
- **Hero image is required.** Create `src/assets/<slug>-hero.svg`:
  - SVG, `viewBox="0 0 1200 630"`, `width="1200" height="630"`.
  - Match the house style: dark navy/indigo gradient background (`#0f172a` → `#1e1b4b`), cyan/green/violet accent gradients, subtle glow filters, the feature name as the headline. Crib an existing one (e.g. `datasync-hero.svg`, `documentdb-orleans-hero.svg`) as a starting template.
